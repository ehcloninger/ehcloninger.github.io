The flight left before dawn, filled to the brim with business travelers wanting
to escape the Bay Area before a 3-day weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had my typical seat on an aisle in the second row of economy. My employer
doesn’t let lowly managers book business class or first class, so I’m stuck in
the back of the plane with the rest of the rabble. Fortunately, due to flying
100,000 miles per year, I’m in the front of the back. Next to me, in the middle
seat, was a man about my age. He smiled and nodded as I sat down, but otherwise
made no attempt to communicate. At 5:45 AM, this is a blessing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we crossed through 10,000 feet, the flight attendants let us know that we
were free to use our computers. My seat-mate promptly pulled out his trusty Dell
17” laptop (with the extra 10-key) and connected to the airplane wi-fi. Pretty
soon, his elbows started poking into my sides as he moved the mouse and typed.
I tried to shift my position, but it did no good. So, I put on my headphones,
pulled my hoodie up, put on my sunglasses, and pretended to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I actually did was watch everything he typed. I quickly learned his name
(Roger) and his employer [redacted]. I learned that he was the CMO of a 2,000
person company located in Dallas, with offices in 10 cities worldwide. I watched
as he had a conversation over the LinkedIn chat system with a person they were
planning to offer a director-level position to. I know what they were planning
to pay him ($220,000 plus 25% performance bonus). I know the person currently
holding this position is going to be surprised when they replace him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roger was using Outlook (not OWA) on his Dell and was not using a VPN. He pulled
files from their SharePoint and worked on confidential slides for an upcoming
board meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not an isolated incident. It happens nearly every time I fly to some
extent or another. I’m not nosy by nature, but when you’re stuck in a metal
tube for hours on end, you need some entertainment besides the 3 episodes of
Narcos downloaded on a tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December, I had an almost identical experience. Alex was sitting in coach,
which annoyed him to no end. He had a class ring (2005, Texas A&amp;amp;M) and another
from his military service. He was fit, smartly dressed, and used a Macbook Air.
Every time a flight attendant walked past and moved the curtain to first class,
he was visibly annoyed because the curtain touched his shoes. Each time, he
would demonstratively move the curtain off his shoes, rather than moving his
feet. When I put my arm on the armrest, he asked (with all the vitriol you can
imagine) “Do you mind?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex is a Regional Sales director for a company in Dallas in the cloud business.
They have a project going with one of the most well-known companies in the world
and the results of this project will have an impact on their revenues. The
roll-out was failing and the big company was about to make a very public
withdrawal. The panic was noticeable as he chatted with his sales reps and the
VP of engineering over Slack. Again, I made note of the names as I pretended to
sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, I did not consider telling him of his op-sec failures, because, quite
honestly, I hate to see a prick like that succeed. Sorry (not sorry).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who’s at fault here? These guys are sales/marketing people and not security pros.
However, they were both working for technology companies and we’re long past the
point where anyone with a financial interest in a company can play dumb when it
comes to security. The fault, though, lies with the CISO that let them into the
open world without drilling op-sec into their brains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way, I have my own failures, but it’s not letting people read over my
shoulder on an airplane. I have a $35 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/3M-Protects-confidential-information-PFNAP002/dp/B006OZEIKS&quot;&gt;3M privacy screen&lt;/a&gt;
on my laptop and it only comes off if I want the person to read over my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Eric Cloninger</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="work" /><category term="travel" /><summary type="html">A couple weeks back, I was on a flight leaving San Jose on a Friday morning.

As a social site, G+ stopped being relevant years ago. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into why, because it won&amp;rsquo;t change the way Google manages their products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used G+ in place of FaceBook for the better part of 2 years. I downloaded my archive of posts from G+ and cherry&amp;ndash;picked some of the more insightful (or less), humorous (or not), or poignant. I hope you enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

Beau said her daddy threatens her with it all the time.&lt;p&gt;We live in a single story house, by the way. And I don&amp;rsquo;t threaten her with defenestration. I threaten her with the wood chipper.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

He&amp;rsquo;s not as purty as he was any more, but he seems like a heck of a guy. He&amp;rsquo;s having a banner year for a swan song. And people are saying &amp;ldquo;&lt;i&gt;are you sure you want to quit? You can stay, you know.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rdquo; Of course he can stay, but he can also leave. He can leave on top, spend a few years with his kids while they are growing up, and still have some knees.&lt;p&gt;Good luck, Chipper. Thanks for the memories.

I registered ericcloninger.com in June 2001.

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first iteration was hosted on a Frankenbox
that I built from parts. It was just a motherboard, power supply, hard drive, and RAM that sat on a shelf in my
office. It didn't even have a case or any fans. It ran an early version of what is now known as a LAMP
(Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). It was connected to my home broadband connection.

&lt;p&gt;It didn't take long to realize that hosting a website on a home broadband connection was a bad idea.

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;margin:0 10px 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/2018/03/11/Version-7-0/DSC00773.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Alpha web server. Count the number of bad ideas.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Even in 2001, long before we were all streaming Netflix and Spotify, having an inbound connection from the open
Internet caused lots of problems. My little server was constantly bombarded by connection attempts that weren't
interested in me, other than as an opportunity for mischief. So, I moved my domain to a virtual hosting provider.

&lt;p&gt;As I learned more about web programming, I added dynamic pages generated by PHP and driven by content in a MySQL
database. That's when I learned about sanitizing inputs and what is now called an SQL Injection attack. The owner of
my virtual host called me at home to tell me he was deactivating my site because it was generating tens of thousands
of web requests per hour to other sites. Further, the MySQL database had consumed nearly all the disk space for all
the websites the servers. We both learned something that day. Ooops.

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I scrapped the home-grown PHP site for a Content Management System (CMS) called
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP-Nuke&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PHP-Nuke&lt;/a&gt;. PHP-Nuke had
the ability to add color schemes and custom functionality via PHP code. PHP-Nuke had a number of fatal security flaws
that eventually ruined nearly every site that used it. PHP-Nuke was managed by a single person, so a
community version arose called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.postnuke.com/module-Content-view-pid-6.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PostNuke&lt;/a&gt;
that addressed many of the flaws. Along the way, I added some photos using another project called the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://galleryproject.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Menalto Gallery&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;I realized I didn't want to be a webmaster with this project and PHP-Nuke/PostNuke required too much effort. I just
wanted to write some things somewhere that others could read them. This was long before FaceBook and Twitter gave us the
ability to blather on at length, so I went looking for something suited to my needs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;
is used by hundreds of thousands of sites. If you keep up with the frequent updates, a WordPress site
will run well enough, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=wordpress&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
criminals are constantly looking to exploit WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. I used a hosted WordPress site for
a year or so, but I hated that my site looked like so many others. When I looked at the web logs for my site, I saw
it was under constant attack from bot networks trying out the latest exploits. On a couple occasions, I found where
they had gotten in before the updates. Fortunately, they didn't do any noticeable damage.

&lt;p&gt;I decided I really didn't need a site that took input from visitors. I didn't need to store information in a database.
I didn't need any of the things that criminals and mischief-makers try to exploit. All I really needed was the ability to
show some text and pictures with an index of my content.

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, while searching for a job, I decided to test out &lt;a href=&quot;http://getbootstrap.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;,
based on a friend's recommendation. I liked how Bootstrap described UI elements and made layout much simpler and would adapt to many
screen sizes. I decided to see if I could encode my resume as a static HTML page using Bootstrap. The result of that project
has seen a number of iterations and can be found on the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://portfolio.ericcloninger.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hire Eric&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; link above. I eventually ended up taking
a contract at Samsung.

&lt;p&gt;I'd been working on some open-source projects for work and saw how many projects hosted on Github used
&lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. Jekyll
isn't a CMS, per se, but it solves some of the same requirements. It lets you add new
content but there is no database on the back end. There is customization that can be done through CSS, but otherwise it's
just static HTML with some indexes generated for easy navigation and RSS feeds. Jekyll wouldn't work for a big
company web site, but for a small company, an open source project, or an individual, it's all that's needed.

&lt;p&gt;The learning curve for Jekyll isn't too steep. The hardest part is understanding the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://shopify.github.io/liquid/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Liquid syntax&lt;/a&gt; enough
to do the build-time processing. CSS is a dark art as far as I'm concerned, but I was able to dig into it enough to
make some stylistic changes to my site.

&lt;p&gt;I deployed the first version of a Jekyll site for my personal stuff some time in early 2015 using a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllbootstrap.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; that
integrated Bootstrap with Jekyll. I spent a weekend adopting old articles I've written into Jekyll posts with the appropriate metadata. I
added a couple dozen articles that year as we traveled to Europe with the kids during the months of June and July.
We got home and I added a few more.

&lt;p&gt;A new version of Bootstrap came out and I realized the Jekyll/Bootstrap project I built my site upon had been abandoned
by the original author. Faced with forking the project and hacking in a new version of Bootstrap, I abandoned that project f
or a plain Jekyll theme that I could customize myself without Bootstrap.

&lt;p&gt;Late in 2015, life got complicated, then it got horrible. It's still complicated, but a lot less horrible.

&lt;p&gt;A month or so ago, I was looking at the Google Analytics for my site. My aging content didn't have many visitors other
than spiders. I decided I needed to rework my site. I'm using the same navigation structure as before, but I'm removing most
of the out-dated content and everything that involves my family. One thing I discovered from GA early on, was that some of the photos
got way more hits than I was comfortable with. The photos have been moved where I can control access to them.

&lt;p&gt;I'll keep a few stories from the past, but I'm mostly starting over with content created from this point forward. I keep
telling myself I need to write more, so maybe this will be the time I do it. If not, there's always Version 8.0.

or in a back corner of our garage.

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basement got so full of these boxes, that it almost wasn't usable as a storm shelter. So,
I've been working to get all those boxes emptied and their contents distributed to their proper places, which is often the trash can
or the thrift store donation center.

&lt;p&gt;One of the boxes had a collection of books. There were college textbooks, paperback novels, notebooks full of doodles and class
notes. At the bottom of the box was a book I hadn't seen in nearly 20 years.

&lt;p&gt;After my father passed away, my mother went through a similar cleaning and purging process. After one such cleaning, she handed
me a box of things that were mine. My high school diploma, a ceramic planter I painted as a project in 6th grade, and a hard-backed
Rand McNally Atlas. Those things ended up in boxes marked &quot;Misc Stuff&quot;.

&lt;p&gt;I opened the atlas to the middle and thumbed the pages, seeing names of countries that no longer exist: East Germany, Yugoslavia,
South Vietnam. The smell of old paper filled the small basement. Inside the front cover was an inscription, signed by my grandparents.

&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: left; width: 45%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/2018/01/01/Whats-In-This-Box/IMG_20180307_134314.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;float: left; width: 45%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/2018/01/01/Whats-In-This-Box/IMG_20180307_134432.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;I've always been fascinated with maps. Growing up in a small town in Oklahoma, I didn't see a lot of the world.
My parents didn't take vacations to faraway places, but I had that Rand McNally atlas, the World Book Encyclopedia, and my imagination.
I would spend hours each night, cross-legged in an old chair with an encyclopedia on my lap, wondering what people in Istanbul sound like.

&lt;p&gt;That fascination with maps as a proxy for travel continued into adulthood. We got into geocaching because I acquired a Garmin handheld
GPS in 2001 as part of a work project. I was looking for ways to use it other than programming it. Geocaching led us to nearly every US
state in 15 years, as well as half a dozen European countries. I found myself bushwhacking through a rainforest in Brazil, my guide
using a machete to clear a path, to find a long-lost geocache. Not quite a cool as Indiana Jones, but it all started with a map.

If I were offered a
trip to Paris or London, cities I've visited several times, I'd be ready to go in a matter of minutes.

&lt;h4&gt;Idaho, Montana, Alaska, Hawai'i, Wisconsin, Delaware, South Carolina&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;img style=&quot;float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/2017/09/08/Erics-Travel-Bucket-List/usa50out.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the states that I haven't visited at some point in my life. My mother tells me I was in Alaska as a 2 year-old. We were on a military transport airplane, awaiting departure to the Phillipines, where Dad was stationed. If I don't remember it, I'm not counting it.

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, a group of older guys set out from Hydro on their motorcycles for Alaska. They were gone a month and came back with some
fun stories. I don't think I can make it to Honolulu on my motorcycle though.

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monhegan,_Maine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Monhegan Island, Maine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:right; margin:0 10px 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/2017/09/08/Erics-Travel-Bucket-List/monhegan.jpg&quot;/&gt;Monhegan is a small, rocky island off the coast of Maine. It was an artist colony in Victorian Era. During the summer it's a tourist
destination, but in the winter, the population dips to only a
hundred hearty souls. I wonder if I could handle living one winter on a desolate rock, with only my thoughts and an old cat to keep
company.
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to take a boat through the islands off the coast of Maine for a few days. Stopping in at a town and trying the local foods and beer. Then get back on the boat and wind my way through the reefs and shoals to another.

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've had friends visit Costa Rica and come back with amazing stories from the country. Despite the wars and insurrection that has gone
on in the countries surrounding Costa Rica, they've always had a democratically elected government.

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Peninsula_of_Michigan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Upper Peninsula, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the Traverse City in the Lower, through Mackinac Island and across the UP. I've heard that Michigan is beautiful once you leave the big cities down-state. Traverse City is intriguing because of a lake there with a river that leads into Lake Superior. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://kayakbikebrew.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;popular activity&lt;/a&gt; is to kayak across the
lake and then portage to the river. Along the river, there are about a dozen brewpubs and cider houses on a 3 mile curving stretch. That's a pub crawl
worth doing.

&lt;p&gt;Mackinac is a tourist trap, I've heard, but it looks so pretty in photos. I would like to visit, if only for a day. Across the UP and down to Milwaukee over the course of several days, stopping in small towns and enjoying life in a place unlike our own.

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zihuatanejo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Zihuatanejo, Mexico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/2017/09/08/Erics-Travel-Bucket-List/zihuatanejo.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Andy Dufresne:&lt;/b&gt; [in a letter] &lt;i&gt;Dear Red. If you're reading this, you've gotten out. And if you've come this far, maybe you're willing to come a little further. You remember the name of the town, don't you?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Red: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Zihuatanejo.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Andy Dufresne: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;I could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels. I'll keep an eye out for you and the chessboard ready. Remember, Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. I will be hoping that this letter finds you, and finds you well. Your friend. Andy.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;This image is the last shot of the movie, as Red finds Andy working on his boat. It was not filmed at Zihuatanejo, but that does not matter.&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not aware of any Irish heritage in my family going back for generations. Not enough to claim any connection to the Auld Sod. That
doesn't mean I'm not drawn to visit by images of green fields, rocky coastlines, and castles.

&lt;p&gt;There are walking tours along the coasts and I can imagine a pleasant day of taking photos of the unique features of the Irish coast like
this shot of &lt;i&gt;Dun Briste&lt;/i&gt; along the northern coast. We would stop to have a pint and a hearty lunch at a pub then on down the trail to
the next village.

Less for the big cities, but it would
be a crime not to see Rome, Venice, and Florence. What calls out to me are five little fishing villages on
the northwest coast, halfway between Pisa and Genoa.

&lt;p&gt;The villages are only a few miles apart from each other. There are no roads to or from the area. There is a trail along the coast and there
are boats.

After the fall
of the Iron Curtain in 1989 we learned that was mostly propoganda from our government to keep us scared of other human beings. Despite the wars that
tore Yugoslavia up in the 1990's those small countries that emerged have many beautiful sights. Plitvice Lakes are one of the many places I'd like
to see.

&lt;p&gt;This idea has intrigued me for several years. I considered doing this hike last year after Jackie passed away, taking time to clear my head and be
alone with my thoughts. I didn't know what I would do with the kids, though, and I didn't think this would be a good trip for them to take.

&lt;p&gt;Many people take this hike and it takes about a month to complete the 500 miles to the city of Santiago, near the Atlantic Coast of Spain. Some take
it as a religious trek, stopping at all the churches and shrines to pray. Others take it to see if they can endure the miles of trekking with no other
supplies. For many, it is a trip of a lifetime.

&lt;p&gt;I visited Brazil a handful of times while working at Motorola. I'd love to return again someday and see all the beauty of the country aside
from the few places I managed to see during work trips.

&lt;p&gt;This is not a world-famous site, so much as a very interesting bit of nature. I love thunderstorms and
lightning. Due to the unique geographic conditions where the river empties into the large Lake Maracaibo,
lightning storms occur more than 250 days per year. Most days, there are hundreds of lightning strikes in
the evenings around this area. It's so noticeable that ships traveling into Lake Maracaibo from the
Atlantic Ocean use the lightning as a navigational aid.

&lt;p&gt;I visited BA for work in 2010 and found it to be a warm and wonderful place. I'd love to visit again and take some time to see the countryside
where the food is grown and the wine is made.

&lt;p&gt;I worked with a woman from Turkey many years ago. She taught me a lot about writing software and told me stories of her time in Turkey. I always have wanted to go to the country she described. In addition to the Great City itself, there are the caves of Cappadocia and the Dardanelles.

We will need to visit soon and take
many photos before these lovely islands are consumed by the Indian Ocean, due to climate change. The government of the Seychelles and several other island nations have started saving
money to establish a new homeland for their citizens when the seas finally take their homes.

&lt;p&gt;Kilamanjaro is the highest peak in Africa, with the summit at about 19,300 feet (5800m). It is hikeable with some preparation. I'd like to visit
as part of a photo safari through Kenya and Tanzania.

&lt;h3&gt;Geographic Oddities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a sucker for strange things that you see on a map.  I see something out of place or oddly shaped and I want to see what
is there. Fortunately, Google Maps and Wikipedia have satisfied many of these itches, but I'd still like to visit.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Bend&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kentucky Bend, KY/TN Border&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; - A portion of Kentucky completely surrounded by Tennessee, Missouri, and the Mississippi River, resulting from the 1812 New Madrid earthquake and a surveying error.
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Angle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Northwest Angle, MN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; - The little bit of Minnesota that sticks out into Canada due to a surveying error.

the Netherlands with a number of enclaves throughout both towns. Houses and restaurants sit simultaneously in both countries and the locals have fun
with the oddness of it all.

		Today, I'm going to show you how you can develop Samsung Gear and Android Java apps using the Tizen IDE for Wearable.
	&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;!--more--&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;
		Previous videos in this series have shown how to install the IDE and Tizen SDK for Wearable. The Tizen IDE is a branded version of the Eclipse IDE, so you can install the Google Android plugins for Eclipse from the Google installation repository. This is a fairly straight-forward exercise, but if you haven't done this before, it may not be obvious, so I'll go through all the steps here.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		I've recorded this as a video, but I also have this as a set of written instructions. If you want the shorter version without all the explanations and pictures, skip down the the TL;DR instructions below.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fWAOajhbyg8&quot; frameallowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
		&lt;ol&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;First, let's go to the Android developers website. Locate the SDK link, probably at the bottom of the page and click it.
			&lt;li&gt;Google bundles Eclipse with the ADT plugins, but you won't be using this version, so ignore their bundled edition of Eclipse + ADT.
			&lt;li&gt;Locate the link the left sidebar named Revisions and click it. Then click on the link titled ADT Plugin.
			&lt;li&gt;On this page will be a link titled Installing the Eclipse Plugin. You can also search Google for the phrase Installing the Eclipse Plugin and the first result should take you to this page. Scroll part ways down the page to a section titled Download the ADT plugin.
			&lt;li&gt;In this section is an URL you need to copy. This URL is not for a browser, but to use in the Tizen IDE. As of September 2014, the URL is below. You can copy it from here, but it may change, so make note of the instructions in case you need to reference Google's original site. &lt;pre&gt;https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/&lt;/pre&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Start by going to the Help menu and choosing Install New Software.
			&lt;li&gt;In the Add Repository dialog, give any name you like and then paste the URL that you copied from the web. After a few moments, the dialog will be filled with the contents of the online software repository that Google maintains for these plugins. There are six separate features in this repository. Check all of them for now, although you will probably into a problem that you will have to fix in a moment. &lt;br /&gt;
			If you encounter an installation problem, there is a solution. The problem is a conflct in version numbers with the Native Development Tools that allow you to develop C libraries for Android. Uncheck this box to continue installing the Android Development Tools. Chances are if you're writing C libraries, you're probably not building or debugging them with an IDE. At least not Eclipse. &lt;br /&gt;
			While it would be nice to have these plugins for completeness sake, most likely what you want to do is write and debug Java code. The 5 other features shown here enable you to do just that. The cause of the problem is a conflict in version numbers of a common feature used by both Tizen and Android NDK. In the future, this may be fixed, so it's always worth trying to install them. If it works in a future version, then it's been resolved.
			&lt;li&gt;You will have to accept a dialog stating that Google does not sign their JAR files. They never have. If this bothers you greatly, you can download a MD5 checksummed version of the plugins from their site and manually download them and install using these same instructions.
			&lt;li&gt;Once the plugins are installed, you will need to restart the Tizen IDE to begin using the Android plugins.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		These instructions are the short and sweet way to get working with Android in any Eclipse IDE as fast as possible, but they aren't guaranteed to work all the time. They work as of the time I wrote them, but some of the details or links may change, so refer to the full instructions if they stop working.
		&lt;ol&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Start the IDE. Go to Help-&gt;Install New Software.
			&lt;li&gt;Press the Add button in the upper right corner.
			&lt;li&gt;Give any name you like and use this URL for Location(https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/). Check all features except Android Native Development Tools.
			&lt;li&gt;Let the plugins download, approve that Google is installing unsigned JARs on your system, and restart the IDE.
			&lt;li&gt;PROFIT!
		&lt;/ol&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;
			Wrap It Up; I'll Take It
		&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		At this point, you should be able to create both Samsung Gear projects and Android Java apps from the same IDE. The Eclipse perspective switcher in the upper right corner allows you to change your editing settings between the Java view for Android and the Tizen Web view for Samsung Gear projects.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		This shows why so many developers like to use Eclipse. With one common environment, they can develop for desktop, web and mobile at the same time.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Thanks for stopping by today. I look forward to chatting with you about tools and SDKs at the Samsung Developer Conference in November or at a future developer conference. Let me know in the comments the things that are important to you.

	&lt;strong&gt;NOTE: &lt;/strong&gt;This blog post was originally hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.klocwork.com/android-development/&quot;&gt;Klocwork's Android blog&lt;/a&gt;. At some point those posts may not continue to exist. I've made every attempt to preserve the original content with only formatting changes to fit this site.
	&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;
		Google released Android 4.3 (Jellybean) source to the AOSP repository a few weeks ago. Whenever this happens, I sync my build box against the AOSP sources. Then I spend some time going through the diffs and run a full Klocwork scan against the code, just to make sure no new problems surface.
	&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;!--more--&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;
		I build several Android projects each week and I scan most with our tools. Within certain ranges, I know about how long the builds take and what the distribution of errors looks like. When I started the build for 4.3, I knew I could get on my bike, ride to the deli and grab a sandwich and still have enough time for a peaceful lunch on the patio outside my office.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Needless to say, I didn't get to enjoy my sandwich as the log files showed the build process lasted less than 2 minutes. The culprit was the build scripts are too smart—they check that I have the correct version of Java installed.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Wait. I have the wrong version of Java installed? There's only one version of Java that's allowed with AOSP and that is Sun (Oracle) Java 1.6. There's no way I would've replaced that. I checked java -version and, sure enough, it was Java 1.7.0.21-b11. How did that get in there?
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Truth is, there's no telling. I install and uninstall a lot of software on my build machine and I'm also impatient when it comes to looking at updates. Java 1.6 was still on the machine, it just wasn't on the path. So, I used the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webupd8.org/2010/04/java-update-script-for-ubuntu-version.html&quot;&gt;wonderful update-java script&lt;/a&gt; that I mentioned in a previous post to set everything back to 1.6.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;pre&gt;wget http://webupd8.googlecode.com/files/update-java-0.5b
chmod +x update-java-0.5b
sudo ./update-java-0.5b
	&lt;/pre&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		I restarted the script and devoted my attention to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muffuletta&quot;&gt;muffuletta&lt;/a&gt; on my table. I wasn't two bites into the sandwich when the console window scrolled up, indicating it was finished. I went to the logs and discovered that the $JAVA_HOME value in my .bashrc had changed. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px;&quot;&gt;I honestly have no idea how this happened.&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;pre&gt;# export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-oracle
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle
	&lt;/pre&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Maybe I sleep-walk, sleep-copy, sleep-paste, and sleep-edit.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		I did what every developer does: I looked for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/a/7335524/296758&quot;&gt;solution on StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;. From this post, I whipped up a bash script that alerts me before anything else happens. I put this in my .bashrc with a note, but I also have it in the script I use to kick off an Android build.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;pre&gt;#!/bin/bash
  # Usage: checkjava.sh [java_version]
  #    if no parameter, script assumes 1.6 (for Android JDK)
  # Returns: 0 for successful match
  #          1 for no Java or wrong Java
  if [ $# -eq 0 ] ; then
	assume=&amp;quot;1.6&amp;quot;
  else
	assume=$1
  fi
  typeval=`type -p java`
  if [[ -n $typeval ]] ; then
	_java=java
  elif [[ -n &amp;quot;$JAVA_HOME&amp;quot; ]] &amp;amp;amp;&amp;amp;amp; [[ -x &amp;quot;$JAVA_HOME/bin/java&amp;quot; ]];  then
	_java=&amp;quot;$JAVA_HOME/bin/java&amp;quot;
  else
	echo &amp;quot;Warning: Java not on PATH&amp;quot;
	exit 1
  fi
  if [[ &amp;quot;$_java&amp;quot; ]]; then
	version=$(&amp;quot;$_java&amp;quot; -version 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;1 | awk -F '&amp;quot;' '/version/ {print $2}')
	jver=${version:0:3}
	if [[ &amp;quot;$jver&amp;quot; != &amp;quot;$assume&amp;quot; ]]; then
	echo &amp;quot;Java version on PATH is $version&amp;quot;
	exit 1
	fi
  fi
  exit 0
	&lt;/pre&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Granted, the Android build system will detect this early on, but it takes a couple minutes of figuring out the dependencies before it does the work. I would rather know the moment I open a bash prompt that I may need to give my JDK settings some attention.
	&lt;/p&gt;

			As (bad) luck would have it, the solid state drive with my Linux partition died the week of Thanksgiving. I have backups of the data, so I haven't lost anything other than time. I used that partition for testing and building the Android platform sources and that's about it. It's aggravating to lose the SSD, but not devastating. All my important files are stored elsewhere.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			After the hard drive died, I needed to get the latest code for Android 4.2.1 that came out in late November. Instead of going through the hassles of installing a new hard drive, I just installed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.virtualbox.org/&quot;&gt;VirtualBox&lt;/a&gt; and pulled down one of the ready-made installations of Ubuntu 10.04 (aka Lucid Lynx) from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.virtualbox.org/&quot;&gt;VirtualBoxes.org&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;#8217;re starting from scratch, you should start with version 10.04 because that is what Google is using at the moment and all their scripts are set to use it. When I started a few months ago, I used Ubuntu 12.04 because it was what was new. I kept running into issues with the newer compilers and libraries that are in the later installations. While there are guides to building with 12.04, if you want to save yourself the hassle, I suggest you use 10.04.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Within 2 hours of pulling down the 10.04 virtual machine image, I had all the patches I needed installed into the virtual machine and I was building the Android sources. The performance was good enough for the time that I was able to get some work done.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			When I started with this fresh VM, I ran into a few problems that weren't outlined in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.android.com/source/initializing.html&quot;&gt;official Google documentation&lt;/a&gt;. Over the Christmas break I stuck a new drive in my PC and went through this exercise again. I thought I would point these out for anyone else who may also be starting out from scratch. There's nothing earth-shattering in here—thousands of developers have gone down this road before, but it's good to get this information in one place.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			Java 6
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			If you're targeting an Android platform after release 2.2 (Froyo), you will need Java 1.6. Ubuntu 10.04 has OpenJDK by default but you will want Sun Java 6. OpenJDK can be made to build Android, but the path of less resistance is to use Sun Java. I say &lt;em&gt;less resistance&lt;/em&gt; because it&amp;#8217;s certainly not &lt;em&gt;no resistance&lt;/em&gt;. The Canonical online software archive no longer has the Sun binaries, so you will need to download it from Oracle. Getting the official distribution of Java 1.6 from the Oracle site is proving to be trickier as we get closer to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/eol-135779.html&quot;&gt;Java 6 end-of-life&lt;/a&gt;.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			I've done this twice in the last 4 months and there are two relatively painless ways I've found to install Java 6 on Linux.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;
			Download from Oracle
		&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The first way is by downloading the Java SE 6 JDK from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Oracle downloads page&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure to get the .bin version and not the rpm version that&amp;#8217;s intended for Fedora. From there, follow the steps that are explained at &lt;a href=&quot;http://askubuntu.com/questions/67909/how-do-i-install-oracle-jdk-6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this AskUbuntu thread&lt;/a&gt; on StackExchange, courtesy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://askubuntu.com/users/14356/fossfreedom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fossfreedom&lt;/a&gt;.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; For the sake of this example, I&amp;#8217;m using JDK 1.6b38, the version that was released at the time.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;pre&gt;chmod a+x jdk-6u38-linux-i586.bin
./jdk-6u38-linux-i586.bin
mv jdk1.6.0_38 java-6-oracle
sudo mkdir /usr/lib/jvm
sudo mv java-6-oracle /usr/lib/jvm
# switch to Oracle JDK 6 - webupd8.googlecode.com hosts a nice script to help with this.
# 0.5b refers to the script version&lt;
wget http://webupd8.googlecode.com/files/update-java-0.5b
chmod +x update-java-0.5b
sudo ./update-java-0.5b&lt;/pre&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;
			Build from Source
		&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Another way to install Java is by building the binaries from the sources. There are many valid reasons for doing this and your use case may be among them. Fortunately, there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flexiondotorg/oab-java6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;very helpful bash script&lt;/a&gt; that handles nearly all the hard work for you. Credit for this goes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flexiondotorg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Martin Wimpress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rraptorr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Janusz Dziemidowicz&lt;/a&gt; for maintaining the scripts on GitHub.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get purge sun-java*
mkdir ~/src
cd ~/src
git clone https://github.com/flexiondotorg/oab-java6.git
cd ~/src/oab-java6
sudo ./oab-java.sh&lt;/pre&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			You may get some error reports from the script that will require you to install libraries. Take the names from the error log and feed them into your favorite package manager for installation. For example,
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install libc6-i386 gnupg ia32-libs lib32ncurses5&lt;/pre&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			After several iterations, you should see the script succeed. You will now have a local repository for installation packages in /var/local. You will use this repository for your installation of Java 6.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sun-java6-plugin sun-java6-jre sun-java6-bin
java -version&lt;/pre&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			If you don't uninstall OpenJDK or if you need Java 7, you can force Ubuntu to switch between them by &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6477415/how-to-set-java-home-in-ubuntu&quot;&gt;setting the &lt;strong&gt;$JAVA_HOME&lt;/strong&gt; variable&lt;/a&gt;. You may also need to force the system settings to choose your newly built Java instead of OpenJDK or Java 7 with &lt;em&gt;update-alternatives.&lt;/em&gt; The commands to do this, courtesy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tolaris.com/2010/06/10/installing-sun-java-on-ubuntu-lucid/&quot;&gt;Tyler Wagner&lt;/a&gt;, are
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;pre&gt;sudo update-alternatives --set java /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/bin/java
sudo update-alternatives --set javaws /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/bin/javaws&lt;/pre&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;
			Memory, Like the Corners of my Mind
		&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Chances are, you will want to increase the default size of the stack allocation for the Java compiler. This is done with the &lt;strong&gt;-Xmx&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;-Xms&lt;/strong&gt; parameters. There are a number of ways you can set this depending on your needs. If you find builds failing because the Java compiler runs out of memory, see what the allocation is in the log file and bump it up. I set these with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable in my .bashrc script using the following statement.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;pre&gt;export JAVA_OPTS='-Xmx4G -Xms512m'&lt;/pre&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			Python 2.7.3
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Android team uses a homegrown tool called &lt;em&gt;repo&lt;/em&gt; to interact with their source servers. Repo requires a version of python between 2.5 and 2.7.x. Further, it needs several modules enabled that are not enabled by default in Ubuntu 10.04. Namely &lt;em&gt;readline&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;SSL&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;sockets&lt;/em&gt;.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;
			Readline
		&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Readline is enabled in some versions, but usually the supporting library may not be installed, so it doesn't load in python. You can force readline to be installed by simply installing the supporting library with
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install libreadline5-dev&lt;/pre&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;
			SSL and Sockets
		&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SSL and sockets are disabled from the build, so you have to install the correct libraries &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; rebuild python in order to correct this. Fortunately people on the web have excellent instructions and deserve all the credit for publishing them. In this case, the responsible parties are JC Brand and Grig Gheorghiu.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opkode.net/media/blog/compiling-python-with-readline-support-on-ubuntu-linux&quot;&gt;http://www.opkode.net/media/blog/compiling-python-with-readline-support-on-ubuntu-linux&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;a href=&quot;http://agiletesting.blogspot.ca/2008/05/compiling-python-25-with-ssl-support.html&quot;&gt;http://agiletesting.blogspot.ca/2008/05/compiling-python-25-with-ssl-support.html&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;ol&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Download the python 2.7.3 sources from python.org (find the source tarball link and extract it someone on your drive)&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Install the dependent libraries you need with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libreadline5-dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Go into modules/setup.dist and find the lines defining the build commands for socket and ssl. Remove the hash marks that comment those build commands out.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;From a bash prompt at the root of the python folder, type &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;./configure&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Build python with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;make –j&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Install python with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;make install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;I found that I had to reboot to get python 2.7.3 to displace python 2.6.5 that is installed with Ubuntu 10.04.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			If you need to have more than one installation of python, there is a useful script called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/utahta/pythonbrew&quot;&gt;pythonbrew&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that allows you to switch between them.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			Update != Upgrade
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			One morning I came to my office before the coffee had kicked in and my Linux partition was telling me it needed to update some software. When I had a dedicated Linux hard drive, I always let the software update and didn't suffer any ill effects. Well, at least until my SSD cratered.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			This particular morning, I didn't notice the difference between the words &lt;em&gt;update&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;upgrade&lt;/em&gt;. I accepted all the “Are you sure” dialogs while sipping my Sumatra and, before long my carefully crafted Ubuntu 10.04 VM was running Ubuntu 12.04. Exactly what I didn't want.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			If you've gone to all the trouble to create a VM or dedicated partition just for building Android, I suggest you back it up occasionally. Fortunately, I had created a ZIP archive of this VM disk the day before, so after about 30 minutes of reinstalling updates, I was running again. Let my mistake be a lesson in the perils of system administration before the caffeine has had its full effect.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			SDK, repo, etc.
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			At this point, you're ready to start getting code from the Android Open Source Project. While you don't need the Android SDK or NDK to build the platform, there are parts of the tools that are useful. In particular, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;adb&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; daemon is used quite often to communicate with your debug target. You can build adb from the AOSP sources with ‘make sdk' or you can download the SDK from the &lt;a href=&quot;/Users/ecloninger/Desktop/developer.android.com&quot;&gt;Android developer site&lt;/a&gt;.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Now you are ready to start following the instructions on the AOSP &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.android.com/source/initializing.html&quot;&gt;source access site&lt;/a&gt;. Follow the instructions carefully as there are things that will trip you up. For example, you may want to sync and work with a specific label of the Android sources during the course of your development. If you don't specify this on the ‘repo sync' line, you will be on the master branch. When you first configure your development environment, provide the –b switch to repo to ensure that you are working in the branch you want.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Also, you will certainly want to turn on the CCACHE feature. In fact, if you have a spare solid state drive lying around, you can speed things up by pointing the CCACHE onto a SSD.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			And now for something completely different...
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			We all have our quirks. My dog, for example, loves kids but he hates joggers. Personally, I loathe the sound scheme in Ubuntu. I know the nice people at Canonical don't mean for the sounds to be annoying, but they just are.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Sounds like the ethereal tribal startup can be disabled through the preferences. But there is one sound that I cannot avoid. That sound is the drumbeat that greets me when I login. Perhaps you have an auto-login, but I do not. The first thing I hear each morning is that drumbeat coming out of my vintage Bose 501's. Needless to say, I'm not prepared for it. At least not until the coffee kicks in.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			I searched the answer for this for some time and then realized that I was searching for the wrong thing. There is the startup sound and there is the login sound. This is the login sound. There are a number of ways to get rid of this abominable sound, but the best documentation appears to be described in &lt;a href=&quot;http://askubuntu.com/questions/24946/how-do-i-disable-the-drum-beat-sound-on-the-login-screen&quot;&gt;this AskUbuntu post&lt;/a&gt; on StackExchange. The Login Screen preference panel did the trick for me.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			On to other things
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			At this point, presumably you want to build the Android platform for creating an emulator image or flashable ROM. In a future article, I'll go into tips on that with various reference devices. We'll also start going into ways that you can improve the quality, reliability, and performance of your system builds with static analysis.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Did you have any challenges getting your build environment set up? Share them in the comments and let others learn from your experiences. If you are the twittering type, follow me at &lt;strike&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://twitter.com/kloceric&quot;&gt;@kloceric&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://twitter.com/ericc&quot;&gt;@ericc&lt;/a&gt; and give me a shout.

When you first configure your development environment, provide the –b switch to repo to ensure that you are working in the branch you want. Also, you will certainly want to turn on the CCACHE feature. In fact, if you have a spare solid state drive lying around, you can speed things up by pointing the CCACHE onto a SSD. And now for something completely different... We all have our quirks. My dog, for example, loves kids but he hates joggers. Personally, I loathe the sound scheme in Ubuntu. I know the nice people at Canonical don't mean for the sounds to be annoying, but they just are. Sounds like the ethereal tribal startup can be disabled through the preferences. But there is one sound that I cannot avoid. That sound is the drumbeat that greets me when I login. Perhaps you have an auto-login, but I do not. The first thing I hear each morning is that drumbeat coming out of my vintage Bose 501's. Needless to say, I'm not prepared for it. At least not until the coffee kicks in. I searched the answer for this for some time and then realized that I was searching for the wrong thing. There is the startup sound and there is the login sound. This is the login sound. There are a number of ways to get rid of this abominable sound, but the best documentation appears to be described in this AskUbuntu post on StackExchange. The Login Screen preference panel did the trick for me. On to other things At this point, presumably you want to build the Android platform for creating an emulator image or flashable ROM. In a future article, I'll go into tips on that with various reference devices. We'll also start going into ways that you can improve the quality, reliability, and performance of your system builds with static analysis.

		Hello Everyone!
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		One of the drawbacks of being a manager is I long for the days when I wasn't a manager. This was when things were simple and I just had to worry about the code I wrote. At least that's the way I remember life before Product Management. The MOTODEV tools team won't let me submit code into production, so I have to keep my code skills up to date on my own.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		I started writing an Android app late last year and I've been improving it every now and then. I started the project because I wanted to better understand how developers use our tools and what the pain points are. What came out of that experiment is a new laundry list of requirements for the dev team. I think they hope I give up development and stick to comedy in the future.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		I'm here today to announce that the latest release of MOTODEV Studio is now available from the &lt;em&gt;download site&lt;/em&gt; . I'm hoping that some of the requirements I came up with will make your jobs easier.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;
		One Step Forward, One Step Back
	&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		I'm going to back up a step before going into the new features of MOTODEV Studio. I want to remind everyone that there are now 2 distinct ways to install MOTODEV Studio. How you work with the ADT plugins and the Android SDK will govern how you install the product. I'm going to paraphrase from my &lt;em&gt;earlier MOTODEV Studio 4.0 announcement&lt;/em&gt; ...
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;Do you always want the latest plugins and SDK tools the moment the Android tools team releases them?&lt;/em&gt;
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		If the answer to that question is &quot;No&quot;, then you should continue to install MOTODEV Studio the way you always have. Just download the install package from our web site or the Eclipse plugin archive and work the way you always have. Or choose &quot;Update MOTODEV Studio&quot; from the MOTODEV menu. The installer version of MOTODEV Studio is locked to a specific version of ADT (and by extension the Android SDK). When a new version of the plugins or SDK are released, we won't support it until the next release of MOTODEV Studio.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		If you answered &quot;Yes&quot; then you will need to install the &quot;MOTODEV Core Plugins&quot;. This package has no dependencies on ADT, yet it delivers much of the functionality of the full product. Using this package, you can update Eclipse and/or ADT independent of the MOTODEV plugins and everything should continue to work. You will notice that the locations of things will have moved to accommodate working inside the Java Perspective, but &lt;em&gt;most of the functionality&lt;/em&gt; is still there. There is no installer for the core plugins--you download and install Eclipse separately and then install the MOTODEV plugins using &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help&amp;gt;Eclipse Marketplace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. For developers who are interested primarily in developing for Android, the new &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Eclipse for Mobile Developers package&lt;/a&gt; is configured to work with ADT and the MOTODEV core plugins.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;
		Keys to the Kingdom
	&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		One of the things I felt was confusing when I was writing my app this spring was the way apps are signed before going into the Google Play store. The Android development process allows developers to create their keys and sign apps with those keys. This was a big change from the previous world we were used to with Java ME where a manufacturer or carrier would bless an app with a certificate from their central authority. We had some signing capabilities in MOTODEV Studio that we carried over from the Java ME days, but they really weren't in tune with what Android developers needed.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		We tore out the old signing view and created something new that works with multiple keystore formats and gives you a lot of options for managing keys and signing apps. This view and the way it works is compatible with the jarsigner process that is used by the ADT export wizard. In most cases, it is calling the same tools underneath, but we use context and serialization to make many of the workflows simpler.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;img style=&quot;margin:0 10px 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/2012/07/25/MOTODEV-Studio-4.1/original(1).jpg&quot; alt=&quot;signingView.png&quot;&gt;
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		After you've installed MOTODEV Studio 4.1, this view should be visible along the bottom of the workspace with the problems view, device manager, etc. Eclipse has difficulty dealing with new or changed views in existing workspaces, so if you do not see the view, you can manually add it with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Window&amp;gt;Show View&amp;gt;Other&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Another way to make it appear is to reset the perspective (if you use the MOTODEV Studio perspective) with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Window&amp;gt;Reset Perspective&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		This view provides the ability to back up your keystores and gives you a subtle reminder of the last time you backed up. I'll bet many of you don't do this often enough. If you were to lose your keystore, you wouldn't be able to update your app on the Google Play store. Even more problematic is you would have to use a different signature in the new app's manifest. Would your users be happy if they had to install a completely new version of the app, just because you changed the signing key? What if you had a paid app or one that dozens of other apps relied on? Even if you don't use this feature, &lt;em&gt;please back up your keystore today&lt;/em&gt; .
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		The Signing and Keys view is available in the full product of MOTODEV Studio, but it is not in the core plugins because it requires information from ADT.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;
		Ring in the New
	&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Every year, the Eclipse Foundation creates a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;coordinated release&lt;/a&gt; in late June. Last year, the code name for the release was called &quot;Indigo&quot; and this year it is &quot;Juno&quot;. In years past, the MOTODEV tools team has participated in the train by including the Sequoyah open source components. This year, we opted out, but we haven't been quiet. Myself and several of the MOTODEV tools team created a new &quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-mobile-developers/junor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Eclipse for Mobile Developers&lt;/a&gt; &quot; package that anyone can use to create their mobile IDE. In fact, we used this package as the basis for MOTODEV Studio 4.1.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Google released new ADT plugins at the Google IO conference in late June. These plugins support the latest SDK tools and platforms for Jelly Bean and earlier. There were a few bugs reported in the plugins, so Google has released an update to version 20.0.1. MOTODEV Studio 4.1 contains these updated plugins.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; As we were pushing this release out, Google made another update of the ADT plugins to fix a critical bug. Our testing shows that this release works with MOTODEV Studio 4.1. If you need to update to get this patch, you are encouraged to do so using &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MOTODEV&amp;gt;Update MOTODEV Studio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;
		Ring out the Old
	&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		As a product manager or developer, it's important to look at your product with a critical eye and see if it's still relevant to your customers. This is true, no matter what the product and whether it's free or costs money. Based on the download reports I get, more people are downloading MOTODEV Studio than ever before. This leads me to hope that we're doing the right things, but without a critical eye, we might get complacent.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		There have been quite a few features that MOTODEV Studio had in earlier times. For example the ability to download the SDK and platforms from the IDE. At some point, the Google plugins gained this ability, so our feature was no longer necessary. In a similar vein, the ability to download SDK addons for the emulator has been in our tools for a long time, but now the Android SDK Manager provides the same function. We've spent some time this release removing our overlapping features. Several of these features were grouped under the Download Components window, which is now gone from the MOTODEV menu.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		One feature that overlaps in a way, but isn't going away, is our App Validator. This static analysis tool does overlap in its function with the Android '&lt;em&gt;lint&lt;/em&gt;' tool, but lint does not do everything that App Validator does. At least not yet. We don't want to compete with our friends at Google on tools, especially since all our tools are free, but we also see that this tool still has some usefulness. Use both tools to improve your apps and when the time comes, we will look to put App Validator out to pasture if it makes sense to do so.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;
		The Fork in the Road
	&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Where do we go from here? Now that the Google acquisition of Motorola is complete, we hope to have some intense discussions about tools. There's nothing to announce at this time because we're all still digging out from Google IO, summer vacations, and things like that. When we have some news for you on that front, I'll let you know.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Until then, keep developing great apps. If you have problems with the tools or getting them installed, let us know on our &lt;em&gt;discussion boards&lt;/em&gt; .
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Thank you for using MOTODEV Studio
	&lt;/p&gt;

		Hello everyone,
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Two weeks ago at Google I/O, we saw the release of a new Android version and new tools for the SDK. These tools had been anticipated for some time and I wanted to update you on where we stand with MOTODEV Studio.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		When we announced MOTODEV Studio 4.0 in May, I pointed out &lt;em&gt;in this blog post&lt;/em&gt; that we were splitting the concept of the MOTODEV tools into 2 pieces. The standalone product with the installer was tightly integrated with the ADT plugins and requires work on our part whenever ADT is updated. At the same time, we also announced a new &quot;core plugins&quot; feature that can be installed into Eclipse that has no dependencies on ADT whatsoever. While the look of the two versions is different, most of the &lt;em&gt;functionality of the full product exists in the core plugins&lt;/em&gt; . The full product is meant to be stable, but would only be updated on our quarterly schedule. When new versions of ADT come out, they may or may not work with the existing full MOTODEV Studio but they should work with Eclipse and the MOTODEV core plugins.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		For this reason, &lt;u&gt;we locked MOTODEV Studio 4.0 to ADT 18 in order to prevent updates that would result in a breakage due to API changes beyond our control&lt;/u&gt;. Unfortunately, the SDK Manager allowed developers to update their SDK tools and SDK 20 has problems with ADT 18. We're working on a new version of MOTODEV Studio that has ADT 20 (or 20.0.1) already built-in that works with SDK tools 20. I anticipate you will have access to it in a few weeks. Until that time, &lt;strong&gt;you should not update the SDK tools or attempt to manually install ADT 20 into MOTODEV Studio&lt;/strong&gt;.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		If you are using the MOTODEV core plugins with Eclipse, you can use ADT 20 and SDK Tools 20.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;
		Roll back SDK tools
	&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		If you've already updated to SDK Tools 20 and you're using the installed MOTODEV Studio, there's a good chance that things will not work correctly. Especially when debugging with the emulator. If you want to continue using the MOTODEV Studio tools to develop for Ice Cream Sandwich and earlier, you can download the older SDK tools version 19 at &lt;a target=&quot;_self&quot; href=&quot;http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r19-windows.zip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r19-windows.zip&lt;/a&gt; . &lt;a target=&quot;_self&quot; href=&quot;http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r19-macosx.zip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mac OSX&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target=&quot;_self&quot; href=&quot;http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r19-linux.zip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; users will have slightly different file names.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Using the links above as a template, you can download older versions of the SDK by providing a different release number. The same formula works for the ADT plugins, which can be found at &lt;a target=&quot;_self&quot; href=&quot;http://dl.google.com/android/ADT-18.0.0.zip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://dl.google.com/android/ADT-18.0.0.zip&lt;/a&gt; .
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;
		Using Eclipse
	&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		For developers who need to target Jelly Bean before MOTODEV Studio 4.1 is released, the best solution is to use a clean installation of Eclipse, such as the new &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Eclipse for Mobile Developers&lt;/a&gt; package and update your tools to the latest release (version 20 at this time). Unzip the Eclipse package into a convenient location on your development machine.
	&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;img style=&quot;margin:0 10px 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/2012/07/13/MOTODEV-Studio-4.0-and-the-ADT-20-plugins/original(1).jpg&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Once you have Eclipse downloaded and installed, launch the IDE and use the Marketplace client (Help&amp;gt;Eclipse Marketplace) to locate either the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/android-development-tools-eclipse&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Android Development Tools&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/motodev-studio-android&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MOTODEV Core Plugins&lt;/a&gt; . You can also install from the web link by dragging the button labeled &quot;Install&quot; onto your running version of Eclipse. The MOTODEV core plugins from the Eclipse Marketplace are linked to depend on ADT, so if you want to install both, just use the MOTODEV link.
	&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;img style=&quot;margin:0 10px 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/2012/07/13/MOTODEV-Studio-4.0-and-the-ADT-20-plugins/original(2).jpg&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		If you're more comfortable with the Eclipse Update Manager rather than the Marketplace Client, you can install the MOTODEV core plugins from our site as well. Use Help&amp;gt;Install New Software and create a new update site whose link is &lt;em&gt;https://studio-android.motodevupdate.com/android/4&lt;wbr&gt;.0/basic&lt;/em&gt; .
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		If you find any problems using MOTODEV Studio with ADT 18 or the core plugins with ADT 20, please let us know on the &lt;em&gt;discussion boards&lt;/em&gt; .
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

When we announced MOTODEV Studio 4.0 in May, I pointed out in this blog post that we were splitting the concept of the MOTODEV tools into 2 pieces. The standalone product with the installer was tightly integrated with the ADT plugins and requires work on our part whenever ADT is updated. At the same time, we also announced a new &quot;core plugins&quot; feature that can be installed into Eclipse that has no dependencies on ADT whatsoever. While the look of the two versions is different, most of the functionality of the full product exists in the core plugins . The full product is meant to be stable, but would only be updated on our quarterly schedule. When new versions of ADT come out, they may or may not work with the existing full MOTODEV Studio but they should work with Eclipse and the MOTODEV core plugins. For this reason, we locked MOTODEV Studio 4.0 to ADT 18 in order to prevent updates that would result in a breakage due to API changes beyond our control. Unfortunately, the SDK Manager allowed developers to update their SDK tools and SDK 20 has problems with ADT 18. We're working on a new version of MOTODEV Studio that has ADT 20 (or 20.0.1) already built-in that works with SDK tools 20. I anticipate you will have access to it in a few weeks. Until that time, you should not update the SDK tools or attempt to manually install ADT 20 into MOTODEV Studio. If you are using the MOTODEV core plugins with Eclipse, you can use ADT 20 and SDK Tools 20. Roll back SDK tools If you've already updated to SDK Tools 20 and you're using the installed MOTODEV Studio, there's a good chance that things will not work correctly. Especially when debugging with the emulator. If you want to continue using the MOTODEV Studio tools to develop for Ice Cream Sandwich and earlier, you can download the older SDK tools version 19 at http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r19-windows.zip . Mac OSX and Linux users will have slightly different file names. Using the links above as a template, you can download older versions of the SDK by providing a different release number. The same formula works for the ADT plugins, which can be found at http://dl.google.com/android/ADT-18.0.0.zip . Using Eclipse For developers who need to target Jelly Bean before MOTODEV Studio 4.1 is released, the best solution is to use a clean installation of Eclipse, such as the new Eclipse for Mobile Developers package and update your tools to the latest release (version 20 at this time). Unzip the Eclipse package into a convenient location on your development machine. Once you have Eclipse downloaded and installed, launch the IDE and use the Marketplace client (Help&amp;gt;Eclipse Marketplace) to locate either the Android Development Tools or the MOTODEV Core Plugins . You can also install from the web link by dragging the button labeled &quot;Install&quot; onto your running version of Eclipse. The MOTODEV core plugins from the Eclipse Marketplace are linked to depend on ADT, so if you want to install both, just use the MOTODEV link. If you're more comfortable with the Eclipse Update Manager rather than the Marketplace Client, you can install the MOTODEV core plugins from our site as well. Use Help&amp;gt;Install New Software and create a new update site whose link is https://studio-android.motodevupdate.com/android/4.0/basic . If you find any problems using MOTODEV Studio with ADT 18 or the core plugins with ADT 20, please let us know on the discussion boards . Thank you for using MOTODEV Studio Eric</summary></entry></feed>
