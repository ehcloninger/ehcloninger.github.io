        <p>
          <strong> Transitioned Engineering Organization to Agile. </strong> Throughout 2013, Product Management and the Engineering leaders converted the existing development processes from waterfall to a Scrum-based process. This process involved converting the internal bug-tracking process based on GNATS to use a modern tool. We chose JIRA after evaluating several alternatives. Then Product Management began the process of migrating 8 years of customer requests into prioritized queues, often relying on a Kanban wall of sticky notes. During this time, the Engineering teams were still delivering products on a 1 year schedule, but were using the Product Management priorities and were delivering internal releases aligned to 3-week sprints.
          <p>
            <strong> Competitive analysis of commercial and open-source products. </strong> As part of the ongoing need for information about our competitors, I set up a competitive analysis lab using VMWare ESX servers with Linux and Windows virtual machines for installing, testing, and analyzing products in a consistent manner. Focused on the primary commercial competitors of the company's two products as well as open-source projects to give Account Managers information about how to sell when faced with a competitor at an account. Analyzed public information about competitors and updated competitive information as part of the product release activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong> Product Release activities. </strong> Worked on two product releases cycles for two different products. One was a new product, requiring new marketing content, sales tools and competitive analysis. The other release was a major update to Klocworks' primary product--Insight that required updated marketing collateral and event support (webinars, trade shows).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong> Voice of the customer. </strong> In my role, I cultivated relationships with many of our customers. Two of these relationships were responsible for 10% of annual revenue, while others were smaller customers who pushed the boundaries of the products' abilities. I built engineering requirements that would satisfy the needs of large and small customers, consistent with the company's product strategy.

          Worked remotely, traveling quarterly to department offices in Sunnyvale, CA
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Build and grow a product. </strong> I managed the creation, delivery, and launch activities for Motorola&apos;s development tools on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. The primary product was a branded version of the Eclipse IDE, called MOTODEV Studio, that was focused on Android application developers. Announced in the Summer of 2009, the user base increased steadily, ending with over 40,000 unique downloads per month. MOTODEV Studio drove most of the traffic to the Motorola Developer site from 2010 through Q4 2012.
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked to develop a profile of our users by reviewing server logs, Google Analytics, and annual surveys. I expanded the user base of the product by finding compatible distribution channels, such as the Eclipse Marketplace. Worked on advertising campaigns at popular developer sites to reach new audiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Leadership. </strong> Led an off-shore engineering team located primarily in Brazil with some contributors in China. I acted in the role of the product owner in an agile process. The development team delivered new releases every 3 to 4 months, never missing a delivery date.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Evangelize the product. </strong> I created and delivered 24 presentations on mobile development at 17 developer events between 2008 and 2012. Some of the topics were related to Motorola development tools and others related to the Eclipse Open-source projects that Motorola sponsored. At the events where Motorola was also an exhibitor or sponsor, I acted as our representative as well as worked in the booth.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Open-source leadership. </strong> I led several open source projects at the Eclipse Foundation that were focused on mobile application development. Motorola was a member of the Eclipse Pulsar Working Group and I handled many of the technical duties related to this group. I collaborated with developers from other companies, including several that were competitors, toward the goal of having a language- and platform-neutral toolset for application developers. As a project leader, I reviewed, organized, and presented talks on developing for mobile devices and embedded systems with the Eclipse IDE.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Manage the End-of-Life. </strong> Periodically, we had projects and products that were no longer relevant. I led end-of-life for several services and product teams. In some cases, this meant the redeployment or release of employees and contractors. My final project at Motorola was the shutdown of the entire Motorola Developer site--transferring IP to appropriate places, writing statements for partners and third-party developers, and ensuring that linked content from other sites would not get lost.

          <strong> Instrument of Change. </strong> Guided development of Wind River Workbench, a branded version of the Eclipse IDE, focused on embedded development. Taking input from customers, internal stakeholders, and open-source projects, I built requirements and negotiated their inclusion into the product.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Growing the Business. </strong> As part of a goal to move Wind River into strategic accounts with IBM, we entered into the Ready for Rational program. My part in this was to handle all the technical details of the certification process. My team and I worked to ensure that our product met the numerous quality and best practice requirements demanded by the IBM program. To satisfy the requirements for certification, I had to create new engineering requirements that were included in the next mid-year update.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Lead Cross-Functional Teams. </strong> The Chief Operating Officer was concerned about the unexpected growth in call-center incidents that required more qualified Customer Service staff. I was tasked to understand the nature of these incidents and then create a plan to address them. I surveyed several years of call center data and post-support surveys and identified a small number of situations that accounted for nearly 60% of all incidents. These issues were addressed in future releases, leading to reduced call volume and overall improvement in customer satisfaction. </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Drive Organizational Change. </strong> I identified that many of the problems with the product had an underlying cause in the way engineering did its job. Developers would check in code with compiler warnings and without peer review. I argued that the first change should be to clean up all code to compile at the <em> lint - 1 </em> (/W3) and force developers to treat warnings as errors (/WX). The next step of formal code reviews before checkin occurred after I left.

        <p>
          Worked remotely from Austin, TX, traveling quarterly to company headquarters in Sunnyvale, CA
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Build a Happy Customer. </strong> I was one of the leads on the Development Tools team, creating tools for the Palm SDK that were used by thousands of third-party developers to create their own apps for Palm OS. We created GUI and automated tools that ran on Windows and MacOS.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Resolve Internal Tools Needs. </strong> As new features were added to Palm OS, many needed to be exposed to external developers. Some were GUI widgets and others were configuration settings. I worked with the internal teams to adapt our tools for these needs. In one example, I discovered an inefficiency in the way binary resources were stored in our ROM that saved over 2K of ROM space. For a device with only 128K of ROM to begin with, this was a significant find.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> See Beyond the Horizon. </strong> In 2002, we realized that Palm OS developers needed a better environment than those provided by the many non-standard IDEs and homegrown tools. We researched and advocated for Palm to become a member of what was to become the Eclipse Foundation. IBM had recently spun the Eclipse IDE out of their WebSphere team and Palm was one of the first mobile/embedded companies to build a new kind of development tool on the platform. Today, Eclipse is the de-facto standard for Java development and is widely used by embedded companies to provide a quality and consistent experience to their internal and third-party developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Growth and Responsibility. </strong> Palm had no presence in Austin, TX in 1999. I worked with managers at HQ to locate a facility and build it out for the employees we expected to hire in Austin. When a facility was located, I was the local manager who handled all the logistics. I also coordinated much of the hiring of engineering staff until a permanent local administrative assistant was hired.

        <td> <strong> Metrowerks (Austin, TX) </strong>
        <p>
          <strong> Pivot the Company. </strong> I started at Metrowerks as a developer who had deep technical experience with (classic) Mac development, Windows development, and the Microsoft Foundation Classes. At the time, the Metrowerks CodeWarrior tools were praised by Mac developers for helping them make the transition from the M68K chip to the PowerPC chip. Metrowerks wanted their products to run on Windows and MacOS at the same time. As part of a focused team, we built the Windows version of CodeWarrior that used the same code base as the Mac OS version and by the time we went to market, it was built with the CodeWarrior compiler instead of Visual C++. This was the beginning of a new chapter for Metrowerks in the mid-1990's.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Build on New Foundations. </strong> Once CodeWarrior was working on Mac OS and Windows, the Company Leaders looked for opportunities to partner with semiconductor, operating system, and hardware manufacturers. The solution was to provide a turn-key solution for their internal and external developers. Metrowerks would work with the partner to create a product, which would then be sold for thousands of dollars less than competing products. I led teams focused on PDAs, which at the time there were several strong candidates--Palm OS, Windows CE, Psion (Symbian), and Magic Cap. We worked with partners on all these platforms. The most successful venture was with Palm Computing and I led this team. For several years, this product brought in $2-3 million per year on a budget of 3 or 4 developers.

						<p>
							Dear Hiring Manager;
						</p>
						<p>
							Thank you for taking the time to review my qualifications. I am interested in a position as a Senior Product Manager, Platform Evangelist, or Developer/Tech Lead. I have 28 years of experience in the software industry and a history of delivering and supporting products in these roles.
						</p>
						<p>
							For the past 10 years, I&apos;ve been a Senior Product Manager, focused primarily on development tools and mobile devices. During this time, I&apos;ve been heavily involved in the Eclipse and Android open-source communities. I am a skilled communicator, having authored many technical articles and as a frequent presenter at developer conferences. These activities can be seen on the Presentations, Blogs, and Writing sections of the résumé.
						</p>
						<p>
							Prior to Product Management, I developed software for 18 years. I am experienced at developing desktop and device software with C, C++, and Java. I&apos;ve contributed to several popular O&apos;Reilly technical books on Palm OS programming and Windows XP. I am currently teaching myself web development with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition to my professional work, I held elected office from 2002-2016 as a member of the District Board of Education. I held this post through 3 elections, serving several times as President of the Board. I&apos;ve worked with community leaders on &quot;get out the vote&quot; campaigns to raise funds for three building projects totaling fifteen million dollars.
						</p>
						<p>
							I live 1 hour from Oklahoma City, where I&apos;ve worked as a remote employee for the last 16 years. I am able to travel for work up to 33% of the time. While I would accept an offer that requires relocation, I would also appreciate consideration for remote work.
